# Project

RenderLab is an AI image/video creation platform using cloud-hosted ComfyUI workflows as the generation backend.

> **History separation:** the full Project chronology that existed immediately before governance hardening Checkpoint 6 is preserved as a content snapshot in `docs/archive/PROJECT_PRE_HISTORY_SEPARATION_2026-10-10.md`. Earlier Phase 0–13 chronology remains in `docs/archive/PROJECT_PRE_CYCLE3_2026-09-03.md`. Those files are historical evidence, not current authority.

## Product Direction

RenderLab is a fresh application, not a direct migration or visual clone of the previous Studio implementation in `saga`.

Saga is reference material for proven behavior, backend integration, workflow capability, persistence, job lifecycle and lessons learned. Its UI, navigation, component hierarchy, routing, deployed runtime and legacy tables are not the RenderLab specification.

## Product UX Principle

**Simple by default, powerful when needed.**

Users interact with understandable creative goals rather than ComfyUI graphs, worker routing or storage implementation. Advanced/model-specific controls are progressively disclosed only when useful.

## Stack

### Frontend

- Next.js App Router
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui Radix Nova + `radix-ui` through the approved maintained component ecosystem
- Motion for React `13.1.1` for feature-local, reduced-motion-aware interaction continuity
- RenderLab-owned normalized primitive layer under `src/components/ui`
- Server Components by default; Client Components for interactive feature behavior

### Infrastructure

- Vercel deployment target
- Cloudflare R2
- Supabase
- existing cloud-hosted ComfyUI/Modal worker fleet

RenderLab deliberately reuses Saga/Studio infrastructure resources while keeping RenderLab schema, storage prefixes, orchestration, APIs and product contracts independently named and owned. `docs/architecture/INFRASTRUCTURE.md` owns the detailed shared-resource/security boundary.

## Product Architecture Direction

Generation is modeled as:

`Workflow → Inputs → Parameters → Generation Job → Outputs → Continuation Actions`

Generation inputs and media actions use opaque product identities. R2 storage keys, provider IDs and worker routing remain server-side implementation details.

The application must not require a browser session to complete accepted backend work. Once RenderLab accepts a generation, server-owned lifecycle machinery must be able to reconcile it to a truthful terminal state and durable output without relying on the initiating tab remaining open.

## Product Areas

Public:
- **Brand / Landing** `/`

Primary application:
- **Create** `/create`
- **Library** `/library`

Contextual/utility:
- **Media Viewer** `/library/[assetId]`
- **Activity** `/activity`
- **Settings** `/settings`
- **Admin** `/admin` for fresh-authorized active admins only

Image, Video, Edit, Animate, Models and Workflows are not separate top-level destinations by default.

## Current production - 2026-10-09
<!-- RENDERLAB_CURRENT_PRODUCTION_SHA: d7571a230b3f1c5719552628db020823adb4da73 -->

**Canonical production manifest:** `docs/production/current.json`. Release qualification completed at `2026-10-09T13:22:15.000Z`; the verified custom-domain cutover occurred at `2026-10-09T13:25:40.464Z`.

- Exact production application source: `d7571a230b3f1c5719552628db020823adb4da73`.
- READY Vercel deployment: `dpl_5LZbW2kA6bFZpYvy2p8bFXzZ2ABF` at `https://renderlab-de7i5y37u-faresmohamed260-6733s-projects.vercel.app`.
- Public custom domain: `renderlab.faresuniform.uk`.
- Immediate verified rollback anchor: deployment `dpl_4E38yZarWfooA4wfEuW5USmPnNsN` at application source `bcb2de305b15f4be15ed42674d22998c30b8c811`.
- Release qualification passed Deployment Readiness `37930497565` and Release Candidate Matrix `37934750620` attempt 1 on the exact production source; the matrix accepted all 23 configured children.
- All completed application/runtime changes included in that exact source are `PRODUCTION-LIVE`. Protected `main` may be newer because documentation, CI/tooling and verification-only changes do not automatically deploy.
- Automatic Git → Vercel deployment remains disabled. Deployment, alias movement and production/shared-resource mutation remain separately authorized operations.

## Current product and engineering state

- `docs/STATUS.md` is the concise current product/engineering status summary and owns the current enterprise-hardening overview.
- `docs/architecture/PRODUCT_CAPABILITIES.md` owns the current capability/product-contract registry.
- `docs/architecture/ACCOUNT_SETTINGS_CAPABILITY_ROADMAP.md` owns Account & Settings workstream state, accepted deferrals and any future promotion gates.
- `docs/ui/UI_MIGRATION.md` owns only the current UI foundation/migration state; detailed closed phase chronology is historical evidence.
- `docs/ui/SCREEN_REGISTRY.md` owns the current screen/route/maturity inventory.
- `docs/architecture/INFRASTRUCTURE.md` owns current infrastructure/resource/security boundaries and operational deployment details.
- `docs/operations/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_AND_RECOVERY.md` owns incident/recovery procedures and the current recovery limitations.

The repository contains extensive exact-SHA workflow, artifact and rollout evidence under `docs/audits/**`, completed contracts and `docs/archive/**`. That evidence remains valuable for provenance, but it does not create an active phase or override the current authorities above.

## Current work and phase handoff

This handoff deliberately does **not** restate completed phase journals or infer a project-wide active phase from historical plans.

Before starting substantial work:
1. Re-establish current repository and production reality.
2. Read the domain authority closest to the requested change.
3. Treat only an explicitly current tracker/accepted contract as active execution scope.
4. Follow `AGENTS.md` progressive phase planning when a new multi-phase cycle or bounded implementation phase is authorized.
5. Keep deployment separate from implementation/merge acceptance.

If no current repository authority explicitly marks a phase active, do not resume an old archived checklist merely because it contains unfinished-looking prose.

## Historical evidence

The pre-Checkpoint-6 Project journal is preserved as a content snapshot in `docs/archive/PROJECT_PRE_HISTORY_SEPARATION_2026-10-10.md`. The earlier pre-Cycle-3 Project archive remains `docs/archive/PROJECT_PRE_CYCLE3_2026-09-03.md`.

Completed contracts, assessments, exact run IDs, artifact digests and prior production pointers remain historical evidence after closure unless a current authority explicitly carries a constraint forward. Current state should be updated in the appropriate present-tense authority instead of appending another historical journal block here.
